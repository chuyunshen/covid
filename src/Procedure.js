          We first divide our covid test samples into batches of a certain size, and test each batch on if there are positive covid cases.
          For each group that shows a positive output (at leaset one covid case), we divide these groups into sub-batches of another size, and subsequently test each batch.
          Then we iterate the process once more to obtain more sub-batchesj with positive covid cases.
          Finally, for these sub-batches, we test each sample to single out the individual cases.
